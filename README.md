ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Olha, a hospitality professional turned data analyst, passionate about delivering exceptional experiencesâ€”both in service and in data-driven decision-making.

âœ¨ With years of experience in hospitality, Iâ€™ve mastered the art of creating unforgettable events, ensuring seamless guest experiences, and understanding customer needs on a deeper level. But beyond service, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the numbers and insights behind the scenesâ€”what drives customer satisfaction, how trends shape business strategies, and how data can enhance efficiency.

ðŸ“Š This passion led me to dive into the world of data analytics, where Iâ€™m now blending my analytical mindset with my hospitality expertise. I enjoy uncovering patterns, optimizing processes, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive smarter business decisions.

ðŸ’¡ Whether it's creating a memorable event or extracting valuable insights from data, I bring the same level of dedication, problem-solving, and customer-centric thinking. Letâ€™s connect and explore how hospitality and data analytics can work together to create remarkable results!
